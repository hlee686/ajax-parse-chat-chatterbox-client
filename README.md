# ajax-parse-chat-chatterbox-client

This is a simple client that lets you set up chat rooms and send messages, and see other people's messages.  It uses the Parse API to reach a remote database, and jQuery's AJAX for getting and posting to it.  I completed this project as a student at Hack Reactor Remote Beta, while pairing with [@bryanbierce](https://github.com/bryanbierce).  One goal of the project was protecting against XSS attacks.
